Structur:

select algorithm typ by SetProperty()
Use as input CaloCusters    (from CaloClusterer)
differnt JetFinder as indefidual classes. Do I want a motherclass?


kt-algorithm:

Use TVector3::deltaR() as Rij
Use TVector3::Pt()    as kt

Parameter:
vector<double>  kt;          // stores the transfers momentum for each particle i
vector<double>  Rij;
vector<double>  dij;         // kt distance (between particle i and j)
vector<double>  diB;        //  beam distance (between particle i and the beam)
